## üöÄ About Me

I'm a Computer Science Master's student at Emory University, passionate about building innovative software solutions that make a real impact. With over a year of professional experience across multiple internships and full-time roles, I've developed expertise in full-stack development using Python, JavaScript, and Java, alongside modern frameworks like React, Flask, and Spring Boot.

What drives me is the opportunity to solve complex problems through code. Whether it's modernizing legacy systems or building new applications from the ground up, I'm constantly seeking ways to optimize performance and enhance user experiences. I've had the privilege of contributing to systems that serve hundreds of users while maintaining high standards of reliability and efficiency.

I believe the best solutions emerge from collaborative environments. Throughout my career, I've worked closely with cross-functional teams, from fellow engineers to product managers, turning ambitious ideas into tangible results. My experience spans from frontend interfaces to backend architectures, and I'm always excited to learn new technologies that can push the boundaries of what's possible.

Currently pursuing advanced coursework in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, I'm eager to bridge the gap between traditional software engineering and cutting-edge AI applications. I'm always open to connecting with fellow developers, sharing knowledge, and exploring opportunities where technology meets innovation.
